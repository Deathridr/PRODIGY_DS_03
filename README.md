# PRODIGY_DS_03

Welcome to PRODIGY_DS_03 Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a decision tree classifier, a powerful tool in predictive modeling. Our focus is on predicting customer purchasing behavior by leveraging demographic and behavioral data. 

**Objective:**
- Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product or service.
- Utilize a dataset, such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of a decision tree classifier using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
- Integration with the Bank Marketing dataset for real-world application.
- Insights into the decision-making process and feature importance.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your predictive modeling tasks. Dive into the world of decision trees and unlock the potential of understanding customer behavior through data!

Happy coding! ðŸŒ³ðŸ¤–
